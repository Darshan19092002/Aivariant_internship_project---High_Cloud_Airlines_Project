 - Total Airlines: 111K
 - Total Passengers: 187,023K
 - Total Available Seats: 243,534K
 - Total Distance Traveled: 82,339K
 
2. Weekday vs Weekend Analysis (Top-Right):
 - 71% of flights occur on weekdays, while 29% happen on weekends, showing a higher demand for weekday operations.

3. Average Air Time (Top-Left):
 - A donut chart displays average air times for different flights or categories, although specific time categories are not labeled in detail.

4. Distance Traveled Based on Year (Bottom-Left):
 - The radar chart compares the sum of distance traveled and sum of payload across various years (2008–2013). 
 - Key takeaway: 2011 seems to have significant operational activity compared to other years.

5. Service Class ID (Top-Center):
 - Class F (First Class) constitutes 72%, while Classes G, L, and P contribute smaller percentages.

7. Growth of Payload Based on Year (Top-Right):
 - The donut chart indicates 100% growth in payload for 2008, possibly due to a baseline comparison.

8. Load Factor by Carrier Name (Bottom-Right):
 - Bar chart shows load factors (utilization) by carrier, with Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. having the highest factors.

9. Averages of Departures (Center):
 - Line chart shows scheduled vs performed departures by service categories like D, I, L, etc. Fluctuations suggest varying reliability across categories.
